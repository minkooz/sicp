# 1.1 The Elements of Programming
Pay particular attention to three mechanisms:
* _primitive_ expressions 
* means of _combination_
* means of _abstraction_
> TODO: find out why procedures and data are not so distinct

## 1.1.1 Expressions
- _combinations_: formed by delimiting a list of expressions within parentheses
- _prefix_ notation: operator next to operands (arguments)
	- accommodate procedures that may take an arbitrary number of arguments
	- allow combinations to be nested in a straight-forward way
*REPL: read-eval-print loop*
Lisp obeys the convention that every expression has a value.

## 1.1.2 Naming and the Environment
Name things with _define_: identifies a _variable_ whose _value_ is the object
```
(define size 2)
```
Response in MIT-Scheme
```
;Value: size
```
No response in Racket
- _define_ is simplest means of abstraction
- Complex programs are constructed by building, step by step, computational objects of increasing complexity
- _interpreter_ makes name-object associations can be created incrementally in successive interactions 
_global environment_:memory that keeps track of the name-object pairs. 
> TODO: learn more about environments in Ch. 3

## 1.1.3 Evaluating Combinations
The evaluation rule is _recursive_ in nature
* First evaluate the subexpressions of the combination
	- the values of numerals are the numbers that they name
	- the values of built-in operators are the machine instruction sequences 
	- the values of other names are the objects associated with those names in the environment
* Then apply the value of the leftmost _subexpression: operator_ to the values of the other _subexpressions: operands_
Evaluation process can be represented in the form of a tree.
- Node with branches contains _operator_ and _openrands_ of the combination of the node itself
- Terminal nodes represent either _operators_ or _numbers_ 
_Tree accumulation_: percolate values upward
_special forms_ such as _define_have own evaluation rule for each
_syntax_: general rule together with specialized rules
_syntactic sugar_: special syntactic forms that are simply convenient alternative surface structures for things that can be written in more uniform ways
Lisp programmers are less concerned with matters of syntax
- flexibility of Lisp makes it easy to change its syntax
- causing more trouble than they are worth when programs become large and complex

## 1.1.4 Compound Procedures
Elements appear in Lisp
- primitive data and procedures —\> Numbers and arithmetic
- combining operations —\> Nesting of combinations
- limited means of abstraction —\> definitions that associate names with values
_procedure definitions_(abstraction): a compound operation can be referred to as a unit
```lisp
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (<name> <formal parameters>) <body>)
```

Evaluate rule: create the compound procedure and associates it with \<name\> [^1]
The \<body\> of the procedure can be a sequence of expressions [^2], each will be evaluated in turn and return the value of the final expression as the value of the _procedure application_. 

## 1.1.5 The Substitution Model for Procedure Application
To evaluate a combination whose operator names a compound procedure
- evaluate the elements of the combination
- apply the procedure (value of the operator) to the arguments (values of the operands)
Two points about modeling
- _substitution model_ helps to think about procedure application. In practice, the “substitution” is accomplished by using a _local environment_ for the formal parameters 
- begin with simplified, incomplete model, then the simple models are replaced by more refined, complicate models as we examine things in greater detail
**Applicative order versus normal order**
- _normal-order evaluation_ —\> fully expand and then reduce
- _applicative-order evaluation_ —\> evaluate the arguments and then apply
Lisp uses applicative-order evaluation
- additional efficiency obtained from avoiding multiple evaluations
- normal-order evaluation becomes much more complicated to deal with when we leave the realm of procedures that can be modeled by _substitution_ [^3]

## 1.1.6 Conditional Expressions and Predicates
_case analysis_ clauses: 
```lisp
(<p> <e>)
```
`<p>` is _predicate_ white value is interpreted as either true or false
Evaluate rule for special form _cond_: 
- `<p1>` is evaluated first, if its value is false, then `<p2>` is evaluated.
- until a predicate is found whose value is true, the interpreter returns the value of _consequent expression_`<e>` of the cause as the value of the conditional expression
- if none of the `<p>`’s value is found to be true, the value of the conditional is undefined
_else_ can be used in place of the `<p>` in the final cause of a _cond_
Any expression that always evaluates to a _true_ value could be used here
Special form _if_, a restricted type of _cond_
```lisp
(if <predicate> <consequent> <alternative>)
```
Different from `<e>`in _cond_ clause, `<consequent>` and `<alternative>` must be single expressions
Logical composition operations
- `(and <e1> ... <en>)` one at a time, evaluate in left-to-right order, stop evaluation when any \<e\> evaluates to false. If all `<e>` evaluate to true, the value of the _and_ expression is the value of the last one
- `(or <e1> ... <en>)` one at a time, evaluate in left-to-right order, stop evaluation when any \<e\> evaluates to true. If all `<e>` evaluate to false, the value of the _or_ expression is false
- `(not <e>)` true when `<e>` evaluates to false, false otherwise 
_and_ and _or_ are special forms because the subexpressions are not necessarily all evaluated. _not_ is a procedure

## 1.1.7  Example: Square Roots by Newton’s Method
An important difference between procedures and mathematical functions: Procedures must be *effective*
- _declarative_: describing properties of things —\> function
- _imperative_: describing how to do things —\> procedure
Successive approximations to compute square roots:
- whenever we have a guess _y_ for the value of the square root of a number _x_
- get a better by averaging _y_ with _x/y_
- continue this process
```lisp
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))

(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))

(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- x (* guess guess))) 0.001))

(define (sqrttest x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
```
> I notice the _space_ between operator and operand can be deleted only if the operand is a combination. For example: `(abs (+ 1 2))` can also be written as `(abs(+ 1 2))`, but `(abs(3))` is not allowed.
Iteration can be accomplished using no special construct other than the ordinary ability to call a procedure [^4]
