# 1.1 The Elements of Programming
Pay particular attention to three mechanisms:
* _primitive_ expressions 
* means of _combination_
* means of _abstraction_
> TODO: find out why procedures and data are not so distinct

## 1.1.1 Expressions
- _combinations_: formed by delimiting a list of expressions within parentheses
- _prefix_ notation: operator next to operands (arguments)
	- accommodate procedures that may take an arbitrary number of arguments
	- allow combinations to be nested in a straight-forward way
*REPL: read-eval-print loop*
Lisp obeys the convention that every expression has a value.

## 1.1.2 Naming and the Environment
Name things with _define_: identifies a _variable_ whose _value_ is the object
	(define size 2)
Response in MIT-Scheme
	;Value: size
No response in Racket
- _define_ is simplest means of abstraction
- Complex programs are constructed by building, step by step, computational objects of increasing complexity
- _interpreter_ makes name-object associations can be created incrementally in successive interactions 
_global environment_:memory that keeps track of the name-object pairs. 
> TODO: learn more about environments in Ch. 3

## 1.1.3 Evaluating Combinations
The evaluation rule is _recursive_ in nature
* First evaluate the subexpressions of the combination
	- the values of numerals are the numbers that they name
	- the values of built-in operators are the machine instruction sequences 
	- the values of other names are the objects associated with those names in the environment
* Then apply the value of the leftmost _subexpression: operator_ to the values of the other _subexpressions: operands_
Evaluation process can be represented in the form of a tree.
- Node with branches contains _operator_ and _openrands_ of the combination of the node itself
- Terminal nodes represent either _operators_ or _numbers_ 
_Tree accumulation_: percolate values upward
_special forms_ such as _define_have own evaluation rule for each
_syntax_: general rule together with specialized rules
_syntactic sugar_: special syntactic forms that are simply convenient alternative surface structures for things that can be written in more uniform ways
Lisp programmers are less concerned with matters of syntax
- flexibility of Lisp makes it easy to change its syntax
- causing more trouble than they are worth when programs become large and complex
