# 1.1 The Elements of Programming
Pay particular attention to three mechanisms:
* _primitive_ expressions 
* means of _combination_
* means of _abstraction_
> TODO: find out why procedures and data are not so distinct

## 1.1.1 Expressions
- _combinations_: formed by delimiting a list of expressions within parentheses
- _prefix_ notation: operator next to operands (arguments)
	- accommodate procedures that may take an arbitrary number of arguments
	- allow combinations to be nested in a straight-forward way
*REPL: read-eval-print loop*
Lisp obeys the convention that every expression has a value.

## 1.1.2 Naming and the Environment
Name things with _define_: identifies a _variable_ whose _value_ is the object
	(define size 2)
Response in MIT-Scheme
	;Value: size
No response in Racket
- _define_ is simplest means of abstraction
- Complex programs are constructed by building, step by step, computational objects of increasing complexity
- _interpreter_ makes name-object associations can be created incrementally in successive interactions 
_global environment_:memory that keeps track of the name-object pairs.
